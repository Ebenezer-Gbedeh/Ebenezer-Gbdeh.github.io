Welcome to the Gompertz Predator-Prey Model Analysis repository, where I made a research to  look into the interesting dynamics of predator-prey interactions using the Gompertz model.

## Overview
In this research project, i did the following 

**1.Equilibrium Points and Stability Analysis**: I Carefully examine equilibrium points and stability criteria to get insight into the complexities of the Gompertz predator-prey model. To understand the behavior of the system, i use sophisticated stability analysis methodologies in my  investigation.

**2.Numerical Simulations with Octave**: With my data analysis skills in Octave, i used the software to implement numerical simulations to bring the Gompertz model to life. These simulations offer a visual tour of the dynamic realm of predator-prey relationships in addition to validating my theoretical conclusions.


## Project Highlights

**1.Validation with Octave**:  I made use of Octave's capabilities to provide hard numerical proof supporting my theoretical predictions.

**2.Real-World Relevance**: This project will help gain important insights into the dynamics of ecosystems by comprehending the applications of the Gompertz predator-prey model.
